## Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting (MTSF):  
In [`demos/time_series/mts_modules.py`](./mts_modules.py), we provide modular components that allow easy customisation of FACTS for *(Multivariate) Time-Series Forecasting* tasks. 


### Usage
We conducted our MTSF experiments using the [Time Series Library (TSLib)](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library.git):vulcan_salute: open repository, making our demo dependent on TSLib. Despite this dependency, for easy experimentation, we provide a fork of the original TSLib with our simplifications in [\[placeholder\]](#coming-soon). Meanwhile, we are in contact with the TSLib authors to integrate our FACTS model into their repository. 


### Coming soon...
